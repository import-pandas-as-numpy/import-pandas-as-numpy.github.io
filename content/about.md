# About Me

My name is **Mike**, also known by my handle "Rem" in most internet circles. I am a SANS Technology
Institute student, with a focus on digital forensics and incident response. I am also involved in the
Python Software Foundation as a supporting member, and dedicate a large portion of time towards open
source security.

Professionally, I work at [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/) as a security analyst by day and run
a Cybersecurity organization of my own called [Vipyr Security](https://vipyrsec.com/) by night.
At the time of writing this, I am also performing an internship at the [SANS Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/)
as a handler.

I can also be found on the [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com), where I contribute frequently towards
Cybersecurity related discussions and help steer new members towards appropriate resources, answer questions,
and assist in internal projects.
