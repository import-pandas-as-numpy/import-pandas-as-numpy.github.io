# About Me

My name is **Mike**, also known by my handle "Rem" in most internet circles. I am a SANS Technology
Institute student, with a focus on digital forensics and incident response. I am also involved in the
Python Software Foundation as a supporting member, and dedicate a large portion of time towards open
source security.

Professionally, I work at [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/) as a security analyst by day and run
a Cybersecurity organization of my own called [Vipyr Security](https://vipyrsec.com/) by night.
At the time of writing this, I am also performing an internship at the [SANS Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/)
as a handler.

I can also be found on the [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com), where I contribute frequently towards
Cybersecurity related discussions and help steer new members towards appropriate resources, answer questions,
and assist in internal projects.

## Certifications

- GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA)
- GIAC Python Coder (GPYC)
- GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)
- GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)
- GIAC Information Security Fundamentals (GISF)
- GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT)

## Tools & Languages

I am familiar with Linux, Mac, and Windows. I largely integrate my workflow between operating systems
as necessary. I use a large collection of virtual machines to facilitate the handling and reversal
of Malware, to include [Mandiant FLARE VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) and [REMnux](https://remnux.org/)
, as well as self-built toolkits in MintOS and Ubuntu.

Additionally, I am familiar with debuggers and decompilers/disassemblers such as [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/),
[IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) and [Radare2](https://rada.re). I've also authored my own
disassembly toolkits to facilitate reverse engineering of specific files or executables on an ad-hoc
basis.

Most of my projects are written in Python, but I'm reasonably familiar with Java and Typescript,
and currently spend a large portion of my time learning C++, Ruby, and the odds and ends snippets of
other languages as they become applicable, or as my interests wander.
